### Detection limits of optical gas imagers as a function of temperature differential and distance(2019)

- overview:<br>
This paper investigates the detection limits of Optical Gas Imaging (OGI) as a function of temperature differential ($\Delta T$) and distance, providing quantitative models to predict OGI detection limits under varying temperature differentials and distances.
    - Optical Gas Imaging (OGI) Contrast Equation:<br>
        
        $$\Delta I = \left[ B(T_B, \lambda) - B(T_G, \lambda) \right] \cdot \left[ 1 - \exp(-\alpha(\lambda)CL) \right] \cdot t(\lambda)$$
    
    - Detection Limit versus Temperature Difference:<br>
        
        $$DL_{\text{ppm-m}} = \alpha \cdot |\Delta T|^{\beta}$$
    
    - Detection limit (g/h) versus distance and temperature difference:<br>
        
        $$DL_{\text{gph}} = c \cdot DL_{\text{ppm-m}} \cdot d^2 \cdot w \cdot \frac{P}{T} \cdot \frac{\text{MW}}{R}$$
    
    - Simplified mass flow rate detection limit equation:<br>
        When using a FLIR GF320 camera with a 23 mm lens and assuming normal diffusion conditions, the mass flow rate detection limit can be simplified to:<br>
        
        $$DL_{\text{gph}} = 18.41 \cdot |\Delta T|^{-1.094} \cdot d^2$$
    
    - Comparison of detection limits for absorptive and radiative plumes:<br>
        Ratio of detection limits for absorptive and radiative plumes at the same absolute temperature difference ($\Delta T$):<br>
        for methane:<br>
        
        $$\frac{DL_{\text{ppm-m, absorption}}}{DL_{\text{ppm-m, radiant}}} \approx 1.19 \, \text{to} \, 2.55$$

        $$\frac{DL_{\text{ppm-m, absorption}}}{DL_{\text{ppm-m, radiant}}} \approx 1.11 \, \text{to} \, 2.35$$
    
    - Calculation of the maximum permissible detection distance:<br>
        If the target detection limit is set (e.g. 30 g/h), the maximum permissible detection distance is calculated according to the temperature difference $\Delta T$, the maximum permissible detection distance is calculated:<br>
        
        $$d_{\text{max}} = \sqrt{\frac{DL_{\text{gph}}}{c_1 \cdot |\Delta T|^{-1.094}}}$$
